data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory.There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the
data structures i.e., one after another.In  other words,we can say that array stores the elements in a contineous manner.
this organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structure.
Tere are also other  ways to organize the data in memory. let's see different type of structures
The data structure is not any programming language like C,C++,java etc.it is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to strudcture that data 
in the memory.To structure the data in  memory ,'n' number of algorithms were proposed,and all these algorithms are known abstract  data types.these abstract data types
are the set of rules.
Ther are two typed of data structure 
primitive data structure
non-primitive data structure
the primitive data structures are primitive data types.the int, char,flot,double and pointer are the primitive data structure that can hold a single value.
The non-primitive data structure is divided in yo two types:
linear data structure
non linear data structure
the arrengment of data in a sequential manner is known as linear data structure.The data structure used for this purpose are arreys,linked list,stacks, and queues.
In these data structure,one element is connected to only one another element in alinear form
when one element is connected to the n number of elements known as a non-linear data structure.The best example istrees and graphs.In this case, the elements
are arrenged in a random manner.
