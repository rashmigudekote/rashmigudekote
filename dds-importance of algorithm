			<h1>Imporance of algorithm</h1>
			<h2>Theoritical importance:</h2>
						when any real world problems is given to us and we break theproblem in to small-smallmodules.To break down the problem,we should know all the theoritical aspects.
			<h2>practical importance:</h2>
						As we know that theory cannot be completed without the practical implementation.So, the importance as both theoritical and practical.
			<h3><i>issues of algorithms</i></h3>
						<b>the following are the issues that come while designing an algorithm:</b>
			<h4><i>how to design algorithm</i><h4>:
						As we know that an algorithm is a step by step procedure so we must follow some steps to design an algorithm.
			<h4><i>how to analyze algorithm efficiency:</i><h4>
						the following are the approches used after considering both the theoretical and practical importance of designing an algorithm
<pre>
Optimizing:Finding all the solutions of a problem and then take out the best solution or if the value of the best solution is known then it will terminate if the best solution is known.

Sacrificing:As soon as the best solution is found,then it will stop.

Divide and conquer:It is very implementation of algorithm.It allows you to design an algorithm instep-by-step variation.It breaks down the algorithm to solve the problem in different methods.It allows you 
to break down the problem in to different methods,and valid output is passed to some other function.

Greedy algorithm:It is an algorithm paradigm that makes an opetimal choice on each iteration with the hope of getting the best solution.It is easy to implement and has a faster execution time.But ,there are very
rare cases in which it provides optimal solution.
