the following are the advantagers of a data structure:
efficiensy:of the choice of a data structure for implementing aperticular ADT is proper, it makes the program very efficient in terms of time and space.
reusability:the data structure that provides reusability  means that multiple client programs can use the data structure.
abstraction:the data structure specified by an ADT also provides the level of abstraction.The client cannot see the internal working of the data structure, so 
it does not have to worry about the implementation part.The client can oly see the interface.
an algorithem is a process or set of    rules required to perform calculations or some other problem solvingoperation especially by computer.The formal formal
defination of algorithm is that it contains the finite set of instructionswhich are being carried in a specific order to performthe specific task.
it is not the complete program or code;it is just a solution(logic) of a porogram ,which can berepresented either as an informal description using a flowchart or pseudocode.
the following are the charecteeristics of an algorithm,
input:an algorithm has some input value to the algorithm.
output:we get one more or more output at the end of  an algorithm
unambiguity:an algorithm should be unambiguous which means that the instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple.
finiteness:An algorithm should have finiteness.Here the finiteness means that thr algorithm should contain limited number of instuction i.e., the instruction 
should be countable.
effectiveness:an algorithm should be effective aseach instruction in an algorithm affects the over all process
