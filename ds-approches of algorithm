			<b>Dynamic programming:</b>
					It makes the algorithm more efficient by storing the intermediate results.It follows five different
                                        steps to find the optimal solution for the problem:
			1.It breaks down the problem in toa subproblem to find the optimal solution.
			2.After breaking down the problem, it finds the optimal solution out of these subproblems.
			3.Stores the result of the subproblems is known as memorization.
			4.Reuse the result so that it cannot be recomputed for the same subproblems.
			5.Finally,it computes the result of the complex program.

			<h3>Branch and bound algorithm:</h3>the branch and bound algorithm can be applied to only intrger programmung problems.
                        this approch divides all the sets of feasible solutions in to maller subsets.These subset are further evaluated to find
			the best solution.
			
			<h3>Randomized algorithm:</h3>As we have seen in aregular algorithm , we have predefined input and ouput.Those algorithm
			that have some defined set of inputs and reqired output,and follow some described steps are known as deterministic algorithm	
			what happens that when the random variable is introduced in thr randomized  algorithm?.In the randomized algorithms,some bits 
			are introduced by the algorithm added in the input to produce the output, which is random in nature.Randomized algorithm are 
			simpler and efficient than the deterministic algorithm.

			<h3>Backtracking:</h3>Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that solves thr problem recursively and removes the solution if 
			it does not satisfy the constraints of a program.
